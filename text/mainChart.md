Happily, some professions are more equal than others. <a href="#" class="topgraph-link axis-control" data-state="proportion-gap">Gender breakdown</a> plays a role. <span class="wide">To the left</span><span class="narrow">Above</span> are the <span class="topgraph-leftaxis"></span> and <span class="topgraph-rightaxis"></span> for each of the Census' industry categories. Unsurprisingly, most <a href="#" class="topgraph-link highlight-control" data-state="female-dominated">female-dominated</a> industries do better. For example, <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="health_support">healthcare support</a> and <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="admin_support">office administration</a> are staffed mostly by women, and pay them better than average--though, still not equally to men.

Industries <a href="#" class="topgraph-link highlight-control" data-state="male-dominated">with few women</a> tend towards equality as well.

Far and away the _least_ equal industry is <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="law">the law</a>--which is also the <a href="#" class="topgraph-link axis-control" data-state="income-gap">highest earning</a>. Other <a href="#" class="topgraph-link highlight-control" data-state="high-earning">high-earning industries</a> tend to be near or above average.

Among industries, <a href="#" class="topgraph-link axis-control" data-state="proportion-income">income does not correspond to gender proportions</a>, as neither high-earning nor <a href="#" class="topgraph-link highlight-control" data-state="low-earning">low-earning industries</a> group towards either end.
