Happily, some professions are more equal than others. <span class="wide">To the left</span><span class="narrow">Above</span> are the <span class="topgraph-leftaxis"></span> and <span class="topgraph-rightaxis"></span> for each of the Census' industry categories. Unsurprisingly, most <a href="#" class="topgraph-link" data-state="female-dominated">female-dominated</a> industries do better. For example, <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active='social_services'>Community and Social Services</a>, <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="health_support">Healthcare Support</a>, and <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="admin_support">Office Administration</a> are staffed mostly by women, and pay them better than average--though, still not equally to men.

On the other hand, industries with very few women, like <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="construction">Construction</a> and <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="maintenance">Maintenance</a> tend towards equality as well.

Far and away the least equal industry is <a href="#" class="topgraph-active" data-active="law">the Law</a>--which is all the more alarming as it is also the <a href="#" class="topgraph-link" data-state="income-gap">highest earning</a>.
