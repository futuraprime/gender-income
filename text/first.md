In the United States, men earn more than women—quite a bit more, as it happens. Currently, the "gender wage gap" is about 78 cents to the dollar—that is, for every dollar a man earns, on average, a woman earns only 78 cents. (The gap is about the same for only full-time workers.) But the gap isn't spread out evenly: in some industries, women earn almost as much men; in others, women make only half what men do.

Hover over a line to see which industries have more or less equal pay.
