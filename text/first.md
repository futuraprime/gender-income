In the United States, men earn more than women--quite a bit more, as it happens. Currently, the "gender wage gap" is about 78 cents to the dollar--that is, for every dollar an average man earns in the US, an average woman earns only 78 cents. (This project explores data for full-time workers; the wage gap among them as a group is about the same as for all employed people, though there may be variations in particular industries or professions.)
